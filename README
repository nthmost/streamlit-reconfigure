# Streamlit-Reconfig

`streamlit-reconfig`

This projects defines a command-line tool called `streamlit-reconfig` that ingests 
the output of the streamlit command `streamlit config show`, parses it into a data 
structure via TOML, and allows changes to that data structure via the use of options 
on the command line.

Examples:

    streamlit config show >> streamlit-reconfig --thing1="red" --thing2="blue" --cat="hat"

## How to Get It Going

Clone this repo.  Then navigate into the root of this repo and do:

    python3 -m venv ve
    source ve/bin/activate
    python setup.py

If all went well, you should now have the command-line app `streamlit-reconfig` at
your disposal.
